######XML parsing tool
The tool uses XML-encoded version of Macbeth from here:  http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/macbeth.xml as an example.
######Instructions
* Type `ruby lib/macbeth.rb` to the shell to see the number of lines, which each character says in the play.
* For tests run `rspec spec/macbeth_spec.rb`
